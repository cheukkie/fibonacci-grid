# Fibonacci Grid

It's a 50x50 grid with the following rules: 
- When user clicks on a cell, all horizontal and column cells of the clicked cell will gain 1. If the cell was empty, then it will be 1.
- After each cell change, the cell will light up yellow briefly.
- If a 5 numbers in a row matches the Fibonacci-sequence, then the cells will light up green briefly. Afterwards, the  cells will be empty again.
